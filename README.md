Hello and welcome to Module 8 challenge!

This application works on the terminal side to create an inventory of vehicles and their specifications as well as towing capacity and the ability to do a wheelie, if able of course. 

For example: You can browse an inventory of example vehicles displaying statistics of each. Or you could completely create your own. Currently you can add a color, make, model, year, weight, top speed and if a truck; tow capacity. Bikes also have a custom option for wheels.
